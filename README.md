# Project #3: Placeholder

## Overview

This is the third project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was to create a **full-stack application** in **teams of 3** and within **one week**.

You can launch the game on GitHub pages [here](url), or find the GitHub repo [here](url).

## Brief

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
